## ‚ùî What is the LZAR?

**Lzar** is a very simple, very fast program that gives importance to the priority of operations, and in which you can do more than just addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

## ‚ùîüîß How to use?
### Using with system arguments
```bash
lzar "1+1"

lzar "1+2*3"

lzar "((1+2)+3)+4"

lzar "[1+2*3+(4-5)*6/7]/2"

lzar "(30*15)-(PI*5^2)"

lzar "3!*2"
```

### Or you can use with only lzar
```bash
$ lzar
> 1+1
2

> (30*15)-(PI*5^2)
371.46018366025515

> 3!*2
12

> ‚ñà
```

> [!TIP]
> Press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> **+** <kbd>C</kbd></kbd> to exit the program.

## ‚úî Installation
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **You can donwload the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/sanalzio/lzar/releases).**

### ‚ùî Which release should I use?
The answer to this question depends on your operating system and processor type.

#### With this table you can select the release you need to use.
| OS | Processor | Release |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | x64 | lzar-win-64.exe |
| Windows | x86 | lzar-win-32.exe |
| Linux | x64 | lzar-linux-64 |
| Linux | x86 | lzar-linux-32 |
| macOS | x64 | lzar-mac-64 |

#### But what is the "x86" and "x64" in the table above?
"x86" means the 32-bit version of the program and "x64" means the 64-bit version of the program.

### What is the "-node" releases?
I am currently learning go language and I wrote this program to make what I learned in go language permanent. But since I am not very knowledgeable in go language, <ins>I first wrote this program on **node.js** and then translated it into go language, so I wrote it for both languages. I added it so that anyone who wants to use the release written in **node.js** can also use it.</ins>

## üé® Usage Examples
```bash
lzar "1+1"

lzar "1+2*3"

lzar "((1+2)+3)+4"

lzar "[1+2*3+(4-5)*6/7]/2"

lzar "(30*15)-(PI*5^2)"

lzar "3!*2"
```

```bash
$ lzar
> 1+1
2

> 1+2*3
7

> ((1+2)+3)+4
10

> [1+2*3+(4-5)*6/7]/2
